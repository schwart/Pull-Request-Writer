###Context###

Here's a git patch generated by running `git log -p --full-diff {{.TargetBranch}}..{{.SourceBranch}}`.

```
{{.GitPatch}}
```

Here is the ticket description, taken from Jira in HTML form. This contains the description of the ticket, and any additional context that might be useful.

```
{{.JiraDescription}}
```

Here are some additional variables that I need you to consider:

Target branch: {{.TargetBranch}}
Source branch: {{.SourceBranch}}
Jira Ticket Link: {{.JiraTicket}}

###Instruction###

I want you to write the title and the body of a merge request. 
It must be formatted in Github-flavoured Markdown.
The `Link to ticket` must contain the Jira link I have provided at the top of the file. 
The git patch contains not just the changes, but also the commit messages. You can use them to work out not only what has changed, but why.
You can use the Jira description to add additional context.

Please write in a terse style. Minimal detail, but make sure not to lose information.

Refer to files and code references where appropriate.

The audience is developers at a tech company, they are aware of the technology being used so they do not need thorough explanations of the entire tech stack. They want concise, clear summaries of what changes have been made.

Please adhere to the response schema.

###Example###

Example title: RC-642: Implement staging builds

Example body:
```
# [Link to ticket](https://weareroli.atlassian.net/browse/RC-642)

## Pipeline changes
- Fixed pipeline for staging builds
- Re-written the publish-release script so it's easier to follow.

## General refactoring
- Refactored the `VeryLargeComponent.tsx` into `SmallerComponent.tsx` and `OtherSmallerComponent.tsx` to make it easier to work with.
- Moved `src/some/Path.tsx` to `src/other/Path.tsx` so it works better with files in the `src/other` directory.
```
